However, before doing so, it's important to understand how Islamic scholarship and texts are structured.\n\n---\n\n## How Islamic Legal Knowledge is Written\n\nBefore studying *al-Waraqat*, it's very important to know that knowledge (as we'll define later) in fiqh and usul al-fiqh is preserved through layered writings:\n\n| Type | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| **Matn (متن)** | A short, foundational text that is concise and is often memorized. Example: *al-Waraqat*, *Matn Abi Shuja*, *Safwat al-Zubad*, etc. |\n| **Sharh (شرح)** | A commentary that explains the matn. May be word-by-word or explanatory. |\n| **Hashiyah / Hawashi (حاشية / حواشي)** | Marginal notes written on top of commentaries, also known as super-commentaries or glosses. Developed widely after the 8th century when writing another commentary was no longer beneficial due to existing works. |\n| **Taqrirat (تقريرات)** | Clarifying notes a scholar writes *on top of a hashiyah or commentary* to correct, refine, or add legal detail. |\n| **Ta'liqat (تعليقات)** | Short notes or remarks, often written by students or teachers. These may explain a point or clarify a difficult phrase and may also be a collection of recordings compiled into a book. |\n---\n\n### Types of *Sharh* (Commentary)\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Two Types of Sharh (Commentaries)\"}\n| Type | Arabic | Description |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n| **Word-by-word commentary** | شرح قولي | Explains each phrase of the matn directly, sticking closely to the author’s wording. |\n| **Blended or integrated commentary** | شرح مزجي / شرح مخلوط | The commentator mixes the matn with explanation, often adding their own legal opinions and preferences within the text. |\n:::\n---\n\n## Why This Matters for Studying *al-Waraqat*\n\n*Al-Waraqat* is one of the shortest yet most foundational texts in usul al-fiqh. Regardless of one's status in knowledge (beginner, intermediate and advanced), it serves as a primary reference that is incredibly beneficial. It is:\n\n- A **matn**, written by Imam al-Juwayni, independent of any other work. By this, I mean that when the great Imam wrote the work, he didn't reference another book prior and is original work by Imam al-Juwayni.  \n- Explained by Imam al-Mahalli in this **sharh**  \n- Often accompanied by **hashiyah** in later editions by scholars. \n\nUnderstanding these layers helps the student know:\n\n- What is original text (matn)\n- What is commentary (sharh)\n- What is later explanation (hashiyah)\n- Where the commentator adds his own reasoning or correction\n\n\n## Mabadiʿ al-ʿIlm – The Ten Foundational Principles of Any Science\n\nClassical scholars state: *\"Whoever wishes to master a science must know its ten foundations (mabadiʿ).\"* These principles provide context about the subject, its purpose, and its benefit.\n\n1. **Hadd (الحد)** – Definition of the science  \n\n**The first principle (al-Hadd) is the definition**. It's imperative we ask outselves what exactly is Usul al-Fiqh, i.e, what is the Hadd for these words?\n\nThe remaining nine foundations of knowledge will be covered in subsequent lessons, insha'Allah as Sheikh Abdullahi has stated, although he's hinted at what some of these are verbally from the first lecture. Some of the things I recall are Mauduʿ (subject matter) and *Thamara* (fruits/benefits in learning a science) to name a couple.\n\n---\n\n## Levels of Students in Sacred Knowledge\n\nUnderstanding one’s level of study is essential, not only because it clarifies which books, teachers, and goals are appropriate, but also because it places a person’s knowledge into perspective and, often, instills a necessary humility about how limited a beginner student's understanding truly is. \n\n---\n\nوَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِى عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌۭ\n\n[**...But above those ranking in knowledge is the One All-Knowing.**]\n\nSurah Yusuf: Verse 76\n\n| Level | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **Mubtadi’ (Beginner)** | Cannot understand a legal issue (mas'ala) independently when reading a text or hearing it explained. Relies entirely on the teacher. |\n| **Mutawassit (Intermediate)** | Can open a book, understand its masā’il, and follow the author’s reasoning with minimal help. |\n| **Muntahi (Advanced/Expert)** | Can read advanced works, understand differing opinions, derive evidences from Qur’an and Sunnah, and explain rulings to others. |\n\n---\n\n## The Term “Usul al-Fiqh” — Linguistic & Structural Analysis\n\n- The phrase **Usul al-Fiqh (أصول الفقه)** is made up of **two singular words (mufradat)**: *Usul* + *Fiqh*.  \n- Together, they form a **tarkib idafi (construct phrase)** — like “House of Allah,” “Book of Salah,” etc.\n\n---\n\n### Linguistic Meaning of Each Word\n\n| Word | Arabic | Linguistic Meaning |\n|------|--------|---------------------|\n| **Usul** | أصول | *Foundations, roots, or that upon which something is built.* |\n| **Fiqh** | فقه | *Understanding for something as it is in reality.* |\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Example in Arabic Usage: هذا / ذلك\"}\n- **هذا (this)** refers to something *near or built upon something certain*.  \n- **ذلك (that)** refers to something *distant or previously referred to*.  \n:::\n\n---\n\n### Fiqh: More Than Just “Understanding”\n\nLinguistically, fiqh means to **understand something as it is**. \n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Usage of Ma'rifah and Ilm\"}\nSheikh Abdullahi brought up an interesting point (around the 1:03:00 mark in the lesson), one that caught my eye initially when seeing the text — Imam al-Haramain uses the term *ma'rifah* in his text, although Sheikh Abdullahi mentions that other commentators use *'ilm*.  \n\nThe two terms are interchangeable in most contexts, but as mentioned previously, one must exercise caution when distinguishing linguistic meanings from technical meanings within a science.  \n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## Difference Between ‘Ilm and Maʿrifah\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"‘Ilm (علم) vs Maʿrifah (معرفة)\"}\n- **Ma'rifah (Cognizance):**  \n  - Perceiving something as it is.  \n\n- **‘Ilm (Knowledge):**  \n  - Knowing a thing and how it relates to another (this is often contextual to a science)\n\n**Example:**  \n- Knowing *salah* is an act, and *wajib* means obligatory is **ma'rifah**.  \n- Knowing that *salah is wajib* and understanding the reason and evidence within the relevant context is **‘ilm**.\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n## Self-Assessment Checklist — Lecture 1\n\nUse this checklist to review what you’ve learned and ensure you understand the lecture material from Lecture 1.\n\n### Foundations of the Science\n- [ ] What is the definition (**hadd**) of *Usul al-Fiqh*?\n- [ ] How is the phrase **\"Usul al-Fiqh\"** grammatically structured? \n- [ ] What does **“Usul”** mean linguistically?\n- [ ] What does **“Fiqh”** mean linguistically?\n- [ ] What is the difference between **ʿilm** and **maʿrifah**? Can I explain it with an example?\n\n### Levels of Students\n- [ ] What are the **three levels of students** in traditional learning?\n- [ ] Can I clearly differentiate their abilities?\n\n### Types of Texts in Islamic Scholarship\nCan I define each of the following **in my own words**:\n\n- [ ] **Matn (متن)** — What is its purpose?\n- [ ] **Sharh (شرح)** — What is its function?\n- [ ] **Two Types of Sharḥ:** \n- [ ] **Hashiyah (حاشية)** — When and *why* did it appear historically?  \n- [ ] **Taʿliqat (تعليقات)** — How does it differ from a full commentary?  \n- [ ] **Taqrirat (تقريرات)** — Where is it written, and why?\n\n---\n\nMake sure you can answer these before moving on to the next lesson. \nوبالله التوفيق.\n\n---\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"01-Introduction-usul-al-fiqh.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
