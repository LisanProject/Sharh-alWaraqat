This project is a work-in-progress collection of notes and commentary based on the lectures of [**Sheikh Abdullahi Shire **](https://www.instagram.com/abdullahishire_/?hl=en), may Allah protect and preserve him, where he is an instructor and co-founder of [**Miraath Institute**](https://www.instagram.com/miraathinstitute/?hl=en). In the current course, we are covering **Sharh Matn al-Waraqat**, a foundational text on Usul in the **Shafi'i madhhab**.
