# Lecture II: Defining Fiqh and Legal Rulings [11/15/2025, Jumada al-Awwal 24, 1447 AH]

::: {.callout-note title="Poem of Imam al-Shafii — Keys to Knowledge"}

أخي لن تنال العلم إلا بستة  
سأنبئك عن مجموعها ببيان

ذكاء وحرص واجتهاد وبلغة  
وصحبة أستاذ وطول زمان

<br>

My brother, you cannot gain knowledge except with six.  
I will inform you of them altogether with explanation.  
A sharp mind, passion, effort, and sustenance.  
A teacher's companionship, and lengthy time.

:::

This lesson continues our study of *al-Waraqat* with Sheikh Abdullahi by clarifying the usuli meaning of legal rulings (*ahkam*), distinguishing obligation from action, and explaining how rulings relate to the acts of the mukallaf. We focus on *wujub* (obligation), *nadb* (recommendation), and *ibahah* (permissibility) in this lesson with the goal to cover the other categories of ahkam in subsequent lessons.

## Mabadi al Ilm — Foundational Principles of a Science

In the first lesson, we introduced **al-Hadd (the definition)** as the first foundational principle of any science. Classical scholars note that every discipline has essential introductory principles known as *mabadi al ilm* which are the foundational entry points that allow a student to understand a field before studying its details.

These principles typically include matters such as:

- The definition of the science (al-Hadd)
- Its subject matter (mawdu)
- Its purpose or benefit (thamara)
- Its relationship to other sciences
- The legal status of studying it

::: {.callout-note title="Resource on the Mabadi al Ilm"}
The Miraath Admin Team (may Allah reward them) have compiled a resource listing out these foundational principles and have allowed space for students to fill in details and examples for their benefit:

## What is Usul al-Fiqh?

Usul al-fiqh refers to the **principles and methodology by which legal rulings are derived**, not the rulings themselves.

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Linguistic** | "Roots" + "understanding" |
| **Technical** | Principles governing the derivation of rulings through ijtihad |

## What Does Fiqh Mean?

Linguistically:  
> Understanding

Technically:  
> Knowing the legal rulings of actions derived through ijtihad

Thus:

- Knowing terms = **ma'rifah**
- Knowing how rulings apply = **fiqh**

Two outwardly identical actions may differ in ruling based on cause (*sabab*), conditions, and legal qualification.

---

## Defining Hukm (Legal Rulings)

::: {.callout-definition title="Definition of Hukm (Usuli)"}
خطاب الله المتعلق بأفعال المكلفين بالاقتضاء أو التخيير أو الوضع
:::

A hukm is:

- A **divine address**, not an action  
- Related to **the acts** of legally responsible persons  
- Expressed as command, choice, or legal causation

Rulings apply to **actions**, not abstract information.

---

## Common Pitfalls

::: {.callout-warning title="Mistake: Saying 'Wajib is the hukm'"}
The hukm is the divine address (ijab). Wajib describes the act required by that address.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Mistake: Mixing act and ruling"}
An action (fasting, praying, eating) is not the ruling applied to it.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Mistake: Treating usul as study of evidences"}
Usul concerns methodology; evidences belong to fiqh.
:::

---

## Ijab, Wujub, and Wajib

Obligation (*wujub*) has three related terms:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Ijab** | The divine command creating obligation |
| **Wujub** | The hukm: the legal state of obligation resulting from ijab |
| **Wajib** | The act required by that obligation |

### Example: Fasting Ramadan

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Ijab** | Allah's command to fast |
| **Wujub** | Obligation established upon the mukallaf |
| **Wajib** | The act of fasting |

::: {.callout-warning title="Incorrect Statement"}
"Fasting is the hukm" or "fasting is wajib" (as a hukm).
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Correct Statement"}
The hukm is **wujub** established by **ijab**; fasting is the **wajib act** that fulfills that obligation.
:::

---

### Additional Examples

| Scenario | Ijab | Wujub | Wajib |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| Fajr | Command to pray | Obligation established | Two raka'ahs of Fajr |
| Zakah | Command + nisab met | Obligation upon wealth | Paying due amount |
| Jumuah | Command + conditions | Obligation established | Attending Jumuah prayer |

::: {.callout-warning title="Incorrect Statement"}
"Fajr itself is wujub" or "Fajr is the hukm."
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Correct Statement"}
The hukm is **wujub**; **Fajr is the wajib act** that fulfills that obligation.
:::

## Juwayni’s Definition of Wajib & Mahalli’s Refinements

Classical usulis differed slightly in how they articulated obligation. Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni defined *wajib* as:

> **An actions whose leaving/lack of performance of entails punishment.**

This wording may imply that if a person leaves a wajib and is not punished (due to forgiveness, error, or excuse), then the act would no longer be considered wajib. Imam al-Mahalli refines this definition to preserve its correctness, giving two valid interpretive “exits”:

### **1. Punishment Exists Even if Applied to Only One Person**

> It is sufficient that *the possibility of punishment exists* and that it is carried out *for at least one person*, even if others are pardoned.

Meaning: The definition holds if punishment occurs **in principle**, not universally.

### **2. Leaving the Act Is Something That *May* Entail Punishment**

Rather than stating punishment *always follows*, one can say:

> Leaving the act *could result* in punishment.

This wording preserves the concept of obligation while recognizing forgiveness, excuses, or lack of enforcement.

::: {.callout-tip title="Key Takeaway"}
Forgiveness does not negate obligation and punishment does need not to occur every time for something to be considered wajib.
:::

---

## Nadb and Mandub

These terms relate to **recommendation**, not obligation.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Nadb** | The divine communication that encourages an act without decisiveness |
| **Nadb** | Also refers to the legal effect of that communication (the ruling state) |
| **Mandub** | The act performed under that encouraged ruling |

The key distinction is that the command exists, but **not in a decisive or binding way**, meaning performing the act earns reward, while leaving it does not entail blame or punishment.

---

### Examples of Mandub Actions

| Action | Why It Is Mandub |
|--------|------------------|
| Writing contracts for debts | Encouraged but not decisively demanded |
| Praying Duha | Encouraged and rewarded, no blame for leaving |
| Voluntary charity | Rewarded, not obligatory |
| Fasting Monday/Thursday | Encouraged by the Sunnah, not binding |

---

### Correcting Misstatements

::: {.callout-warning title="Incorrect Statement"}
"Fasting Monday is the hukm."
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Correct Statement"}
"The hukm is **nadb**; fasting Monday is the **mandub action**."
:::

---

## Ibahah and Mubah

These terms relate to permissibility, not obligation.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Ibahah** | The divine allowance granting choice (this is the hukm) |
| **Ibahah** | The legal effect produced by that allowance |
| **Mubah** | The action permitted under that ruling |

::: {.callout-note title="Foundational Principle"}
الاصل في الاشياء الاباحة  
"The default ruling of things is permissibility."
:::

---

### Examples of Mubah

| Action | Why It Is Mubah |
|--------|----------------|
| Choosing between lawful foods | No command specifying type |
| Clothing styles within modesty | Neutral in itself |
| Traveling for leisure | Neither commanded nor prohibited |
| Working a lawful job | Neutral act, even if earning provision may become obligatory |

::: {.callout-warning title="Incorrect Statement"}
"Eating food is mubah."
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Correct Statement"}
"Ibahah is the hukm; eating food is the mubah action."
:::

---

### Summary — Three Categories Compared

| Category | Hukm (Ruling State) | Act |
|----------|--------------------|------|
| **Obligation** | Wujub | Wajib |
| **Recommendation** | Nadb | Mandub |
| **Permission** | Ibahah | Mubah |
