# Lecture II: Defining Fiqh and Legal Rulings [11/15/2025, Jumada al-Awwal 24, 1447 AH]

::: {.callout-note title="Poem of Imam al-Shafii — Keys to Knowledge"}

أخي لن تنال العلم إلا بستة  
سأنبئك عن مجموعها ببيان

ذكاء وحرص واجتهاد وبلغة  
وصحبة أستاذ وطول زمان

<br>

My brother, you cannot gain knowledge except with six.  
I will inform you of them altogether with explanation.  
A sharp mind, passion, effort, and sustenance.  
A teacher's companionship, and lengthy time.

:::

This lesson continues our study of *al-Waraqat* with Sheikh Abdullahi by clarifying the usuli meaning of legal rulings (*ahkam*), distinguishing obligation from action, and explaining how rulings relate to the acts of the mukallaf. We focus on *wujub* (obligation), *nadb* (recommendation), and *ibahah* (permissibility) in this lesson with the goal to cover the other categories of ahkam in subsequent lessons.
