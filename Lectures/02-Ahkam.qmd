# Lecture II: Defining Fiqh and Legal Rulings [11/15/2025, Jumada al-Awwal 24, 1447 AH]

::: {.callout-note title="Poem of Imam al-Shafii — Keys to Knowledge"}

أخي لن تنال العلم إلا بستة  
سأنبئك عن مجموعها ببيان

ذكاء وحرص واجتهاد وبلغة  
وصحبة أستاذ وطول زمان

<br>

My brother, you cannot gain knowledge except with six.  
I will inform you of them altogether with explanation.  
A sharp mind, passion, effort, and sustenance.  
A teacher's companionship, and lengthy time.

:::

This lesson continues our study of *al-Waraqat* with Sheikh Abdullahi by clarifying the usuli meaning of legal rulings (*ahkam*), distinguishing obligation from action, and explaining how rulings relate to the acts of the mukallaf. We focus on *wujub* (obligation) and *ibahah* (permissibility) in this lesson with the goal to cover the other categories of ahkam in subsequent lessons.

## What is Usul al-Fiqh?

Usul al-fiqh refers to the **principles and methodology by which legal rulings are derived**, not the rulings themselves.

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Linguistic** | "Roots" + "understanding" |
| **Technical** | Principles governing the derivation of rulings through ijtihad |

---

## What Does Fiqh Mean?

Linguistically:  
> Understanding

Technically:  
> Knowing the legal rulings of actions derived through ijtihad

Thus:

- Knowing terms = **ma'rifah**
- Knowing how rulings apply = **fiqh**

Two outwardly identical actions may differ in ruling based on cause (*sabab*), conditions, and legal qualification.

---

## Defining Hukm (Legal Rulings)

::: {.callout-definition title="Definition of Hukm (Usuli)"}
خطاب الله المتعلق بأفعال المكلفين بالاقتضاء أو التخيير أو الوضع
:::

A hukm is:

- A **divine address**, not an action  
- Related to **the acts** of legally responsible persons  
- Expressed as command, choice, or legal causation

Rulings apply to **actions**, not abstract information.

---

## Common Pitfalls

::: {.callout-warning title="Mistake: Saying 'Wajib is the hukm'"}
The hukm is the divine address (ijab). Wajib describes the act required by that address.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Mistake: Mixing act and ruling"}
An action (fasting, praying, eating) is not the ruling applied to it.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="Mistake: Treating usul as study of evidences"}
Usul concerns methodology; evidences belong to fiqh.

## Ijab, Wujub, and Wajib

Obligation (*wujub*) has three related terms:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Ijab** | The divine command creating obligation |
| **Wujub** | The hukm: the legal state of obligation resulting from ijab |
| **Wajib** | The act required by that obligation |

### Example: Fasting Ramadan

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Ijab** | Allah's command to fast |
| **Wujub** | Obligation established upon the mukallaf |
| **Wajib** | The act of fasting |

::: {.callout-warning title="Incorrect Statement"}
"Fasting is the hukm" or "fasting is wajib" (as a hukm).
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Correct Statement"}
The hukm is **wujub** established by **ijab**; fasting is the **wajib act** that fulfills that obligation.
:::

---

### Additional Examples

| Scenario | Ijab | Wujub | Wajib |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| Fajr | Command to pray | Obligation established | Two raka'ahs of Fajr |
| Zakah | Command + nisab met | Obligation upon wealth | Paying due amount |
| Jumuah | Command + conditions | Obligation established | Attending Jumuah prayer |

::: {.callout-warning title="Incorrect Statement"}
"Fajr itself is wujub" or "Fajr is the hukm."
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Correct Statement"}
The hukm is **wujub**; **Fajr is the wajib act** that fulfills that obligation.
:::

---

## Ibahah and Mubah

These terms relate to permissibility, not obligation.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Ibahah** | The divine allowance granting choice (this is the hukm) |
| **Ibahah** | The legal effect produced by that allowance |
| **Mubah** | The action permitted under that ruling |

::: {.callout-note title="Foundational Principle"}
الاصل في الاشياء الاباحة  
"The default ruling of things is permissibility."
:::

---

### Examples of Mubah

| Action | Why It Is Mubah |
|--------|----------------|
| Choosing between lawful foods | No command specifying type |
| Clothing styles within modesty | Neutral in itself |
| Traveling for leisure | Neither commanded nor prohibited |
| Working a lawful job | Neutral act, even if earning provision may become obligatory |

::: {.callout-warning title="Incorrect Statement"}
"Eating food is mubah."
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Correct Statement"}
"Ibahah is the hukm; eating food is the mubah action."
:::

---

## Summary Table — Obligation vs Permission

| Category | Hukm (Ruling State) | Act |
|----------|----------------------|------|
| **Obligation** | Wujub (from ijab) | Wajib |
| **Permission** | Ibahah | Mubah |

## Self-Assessment Checklist — Lecture II

### Understanding Key Distinctions

- [ ] Can I define ijab, wujub, and wajib separately?
- [ ] Can I define ibahah and mubah and distinguish between them?


### Principles

- [ ] What is baraat al-asliyyah?
- [ ] Do rulings apply to actions or objects?

### Avoiding Errors

- [ ] Why is it incorrect to say "wajib is the hukm"?
- [ ] Why is memorizing categories without application not considered fiqh?
