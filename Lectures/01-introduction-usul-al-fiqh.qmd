# Lecture I: Course Introduction to *al-Waraqat* and the Science of Usul al-Fiqh [11/8/2025, Jumada al-Awwal 17, 1447 AH]


::: {.callout-warning title="Intention in Seeking Knowledge"}

> “Whoever strives for knowledge for the Hereafter obtains great gain in righteousness.  
> But he is in utter loss who seeks knowledge to obtain advantage over people!”  
> — Poem attributed to Imam Abu Hanifa (رحمه الله)  

Imam al-Haddad’s intention reads:  
> “I intend to **study and teach**, to *take* and *give* a **reminder**, to *take* and *give* **benefit**, to *take* and *give* **advantage**, to **encourage** the **holding fast** to the **Book of Allah** and the **way of His Messenger** صلى الله عليه وسلم, to **call to guidance** and **directing towards good**, hoping for the countenance of Allah and His pleasure, His proximity and reward.”  

Imam al-Dhahabi notes that a **sincere seeker of knowledge** will show **humility**, **fear of Allah**, and **lack of prid**e; whereas one whose intention is worldly will grow **arrogant**, **quarrel**, and **seek admiration**.

This section introduces the purpose of *al-Waraqat*, outlines how Imam al-Haramain al-Juwayni defines fiqh and usul al-fiqh, and provides essential background on how Islamic legal texts are structured from short foundational texts (*mutun*) to layered commentaries.

## What is Usul al-Fiqh?

**Usul al-Fiqh (أصول الفقه)** means *the foundational principles by which legal rulings are derived*.  
Let's dive deeper into what this means exactly. However, before doing so, it's important to understand how Islamic scholarship and texts are structured.

## How Islamic Legal Knowledge is Written

Before studying *al-Waraqat*, it's very important to know that knowledge (as we'll define later) in fiqh and usul al-fiqh is preserved through layered writings:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Matn (متن)** | A short, foundational text that is concise and is often memorized. Example: *al-Waraqat*, *Matn Abi Shuja*, *Safwat al-Zubad*, etc. |
| **Sharh (شرح)** | A commentary that explains the matn. May be word-by-word or explanatory. |
| **Hashiyah / Hawashi (حاشية / حواشي)** | Marginal notes written on top of commentaries, also known as super-commentaries or glosses. Developed widely after the 8th century when writing another commentary was no longer beneficial due to existing works. |
| **Taqrirat (تقريرات)** | Clarifying notes a scholar writes *on top of a hashiyah or commentary* to correct, refine, or add legal detail. |
| **Ta'liqat (تعليقات)** | Short notes or remarks, often written by students or teachers. These may explain a point or clarify a difficult phrase and may also be a collection of recordings compiled into a book. |

### Types of *Sharh* (Commentary)

::: {.callout-note title="Two Types of Sharh (Commentaries)"}
| Type | Arabic | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Word-by-word commentary** | شرح قولي | Explains each phrase of the matn directly, sticking closely to the author’s wording. |
| **Blended or integrated commentary** | شرح مسجي / شرح مخلوط | The commentator mixes the matn with explanation, often adding their own legal opinions and preferences within the text. |

## Why This Matters for Studying *al-Waraqat*

*Al-Waraqat* is one of the shortest yet most foundational texts in usul al-fiqh. Regardless of one's status in knowledge (beginner, intermediate and advances), it serves as a primary reference that is incredibly beneficial. It is:

- A **matn**, written by Imam al-Juwayni, independent of any other work. By this, I mean that when the great Imam wrote the work, he didn't reference another book prior and is original work by Imam al-Juwayni.  
- Explained by Imam al-Mahalli in this **sharh**  
- Often accompanied by **hashiyah** in later editions by scholars. 

Understanding these layers helps the student know:

- What is original text (matn)
- What is commentary (sharh)
- What is later explanation (hashiyah)
- Where the commentator adds his own reasoning or correction

Classical scholars state: *"Whoever wishes to master a science must know its ten foundations (mabadiʿ)."* These principles provide context about the subject, its purpose, and its benefit.
