# Lecture I: Course Introduction to *al-Waraqat* and the Science of Usul al-Fiqh [11/8/2025, Jumada al-Awwal 17, 1447 AH]

::: {.callout-warning title="Intention in Seeking Knowledge"}

> “Whoever strives for knowledge for the Hereafter obtains great gain in righteousness.  
> But he is in utter loss who seeks knowledge to obtain advantage over people!”  
> — Poem attributed to Imam Abu Hanifa (رحمه الله)  

Imam al-Haddad’s intention reads:  
> “I intend to **study and teach**, to *take* and *give* a **reminder**, to *take* and *give* **benefit**, to *take* and *give* **advantage**, to **encourage** the **holding fast** to the **Book of Allah** and the **way of His Messenger** صلى الله عليه وسلم, to **call to guidance** and **directing towards good**, hoping for the countenance of Allah and His pleasure, His proximity and reward.”  

Imam al-Dhahabi notes that a **sincere seeker of knowledge** will show **humility**, **fear of Allah**, and **lack of pride**; whereas one whose intention is worldly will grow **arrogant**, **quarrel**, and **seek admiration**.

This section introduces the purpose of *al-Waraqat*, outlines how Imam al-Haramain al-Juwayni defines fiqh and usul al-fiqh, and provides essential background on how Islamic legal texts are structured from short foundational texts (*mutun*) to layered commentaries.

::: {.callout-tip title="Fun Fact — Titles of Scholars within the Shafi'i Madhhab" collapse="true"}

Within the Shafi'i school, scholars are often referenced by honorific titles rather than their names.  
These titles indicate scholarly authority, rank, or specific contributions to the development of the madhhab.

1. **Al-Qadi (القاضي)**  
   Commonly used to refer to **Qadi Abu Bakr al-Baqillani**, the great Ash'ari Mutakallim and Usuli, though occasionally applied to other jurists who served as chief judges or early authorities in kalam and usul (like **Qadi Abu Shuja'**).  

2. **Al-Imam (الإمام)**  
   Designates **Imam al-Haramain al-Juwayni**, the teacher of al-Ghazali and a pivotal systematizer of Shafi'i usul.  

3. **Al-Shaykhan (الشيخان)**  
   Always refers to **Imam al-Rafi'i** and **Imam al-Nawawi**, whose opinions together form the later *mu'tamad* (established) position of the madhhab.  

4. **Ashab al-Wujuh (أصحاب الوجوه)**  
   A select group of early mujtahid Imams *within* the madhhab who formulated independent opinions (*wujuh*), later codified by scholars like **al-Nawawi** and **al-Rafi'i**.  
   Some of these include **Imam Muzani**, **Hujjat al-Islam Abu Hamid al-Ghazali**, **Imam Buwayti**, and **Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi**.  

5. **Al-Mujaddid (المجدد)**  
   Refers to revivers of the school’s teaching and methodology in their respective centuries—e.g., **al-Shafi'i** in the *2nd century*, **al-Nawawi** in the *7th century*, **al-Suyuti** in the *10th*.  

6. **Shaykh al-Islam (شيخ الإسلام)**  
   Refers almost always to **Zakariyyah al-Ansari**, the Mujaddid of the 9th century, as well as the teacher of many luminaries including Ibn Hajar al-Haytami, al-Khatib al-Shirbini, and Shams al-Din al-Ramli.

7. **al-Sharih (الشارح)**  
   Refers almost always to **Imam Jalal al-Din al-Mahalli**, the distinguished Shafi‘i jurist and theologian renowned for his precise and accessible commentaries. He authored a commentary on Imam Nawawi’s Minhaj al-Talibin, a commentary on al-Waraqat in Usul al-Fiqh, and a commentary on Jam‘ al-Jawami‘ by Imam al-Subki. He is also known as the co-author of Tafsir al-Jalalayn, completed by his student Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti.

## What is Usul al-Fiqh?

**Usul al-Fiqh (أصول الفقه)** means *the foundational principles by which legal rulings are derived*.  
Let's dive deeper into what this means exactly. However, before doing so, it's important to understand how Islamic scholarship and texts are structured.

---

## How Islamic Legal Knowledge is Written

Before studying *al-Waraqat*, it's very important to know that knowledge (as we'll define later) in fiqh and usul al-fiqh is preserved through layered writings:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Matn (متن)** | A short, foundational text that is concise and is often memorized. Example: *al-Waraqat*, *Matn Abi Shuja*, *Safwat al-Zubad*, etc. |
| **Sharh (شرح)** | A commentary that explains the matn. May be word-by-word or explanatory. |
| **Hashiyah / Hawashi (حاشية / حواشي)** | Marginal notes written on top of commentaries, also known as super-commentaries or glosses. Developed widely after the 8th century when writing another commentary was no longer beneficial due to existing works. |
| **Taqrirat (تقريرات)** | Clarifying notes a scholar writes *on top of a hashiyah or commentary* to correct, refine, or add legal detail. |
| **Ta'liqat (تعليقات)** | Short notes or remarks, often written by students or teachers. These may explain a point or clarify a difficult phrase and may also be a collection of recordings compiled into a book. |
---

### Types of *Sharh* (Commentary)

::: {.callout-note title="Two Types of Sharh (Commentaries)"}
| Type | Arabic | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Word-by-word commentary** | شرح قولي | Explains each phrase of the matn directly, sticking closely to the author’s wording. |
| **Blended or integrated commentary** | شرح مزجي / شرح مخلوط | The commentator mixes the matn with explanation, often adding their own legal opinions and preferences within the text. |
:::
---

## Why This Matters for Studying *al-Waraqat*

*Al-Waraqat* is one of the shortest yet most foundational texts in usul al-fiqh. Regardless of one's status in knowledge (beginner, intermediate and advanced), it serves as a primary reference that is incredibly beneficial. It is:

- A **matn**, written by Imam al-Juwayni, independent of any other work. By this, I mean that when the great Imam wrote the work, he didn't reference another book prior and is original work by Imam al-Juwayni.  
- Explained by Imam al-Mahalli in this **sharh**  
- Often accompanied by **hashiyah** in later editions by scholars. 

Understanding these layers helps the student know:

- What is original text (matn)
- What is commentary (sharh)
- What is later explanation (hashiyah)
- Where the commentator adds his own reasoning or correction


## Mabadiʿ al-ʿIlm – The Ten Foundational Principles of Any Science

Classical scholars state: *"Whoever wishes to master a science must know its ten foundations (mabadiʿ)."* These principles provide context about the subject, its purpose, and its benefit.

1. **Hadd (الحد)** – Definition of the science  

**The first principle (al-Hadd) is the definition**. It's imperative we ask outselves what exactly is Usul al-Fiqh, i.e, what is the Hadd for these words?

The remaining nine foundations of knowledge will be covered in subsequent lessons, insha'Allah as Sheikh Abdullahi has stated, although he's hinted at what some of these are verbally from the first lecture. Some of the things I recall are *Mauduʿ* (subject matter) and *Thamara* (fruits/benefits in learning a science) to name a couple.

---

## Levels of Students in Sacred Knowledge

Understanding one’s level of study is essential, not only because it clarifies which books, teachers, and goals are appropriate, but also because it places a person’s knowledge into perspective and, often, instills a necessary humility about how limited a beginner student's understanding truly is.

وَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِى عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌۭ

[**...But above those ranking in knowledge is the One All-Knowing.**]

Surah Yusuf: Verse 76

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Mubtadi’ (Beginner)** | Cannot understand a legal issue (mas'ala) independently when reading a text or hearing it explained. Relies entirely on the teacher. |
| **Mutawassit (Intermediate)** | Can open a book, understand its masā’il, and follow the author’s reasoning with minimal help. |
| **Muntahi (Advanced/Expert)** | Can read advanced works, understand differing opinions, derive evidences from Qur’an and Sunnah, and explain rulings to others. |

## The Term “Usul al-Fiqh” — Linguistic & Structural Analysis

- The phrase **Usul al-Fiqh (أصول الفقه)** is made up of **two singular words (mufradat)**: *Usul* + *Fiqh*.  
- Together, they form a **tarkib idafi (construct phrase)** — like “House of Allah,” “Book of Salah,” etc.

---

### Linguistic Meaning of Each Word

| Word | Arabic | Linguistic Meaning |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| **Usul** | أصول | *Foundations, roots, or that upon which something is built.* |
| **Fiqh** | فقه | *Literally understanding something.* |

::: {.callout-tip title="Example in Arabic Usage: هذا / ذلك"}
- **هذا (this)** refers to something *near or built upon something certain*.  
- **ذلك (that)** refers to something *distant or previously referred to*.  
:::

---

### Fiqh: More Than Just “Understanding”

Linguistically, fiqh means to **understand something as it is**. 

::: {.callout-note title="Usage of Ma'rifah and Ilm"}
Sheikh Abdullahi brought up an interesting point (around the **1:03:00** mark in the lesson), one that caught my eye initially when seeing the text — Imam al-Haramain uses the term *ma'rifah* in his text, although Sheikh Abdullahi mentions that other commentators use *'ilm*.  

The two terms are interchangeable in most contexts, but as mentioned previously, one must exercise caution when distinguishing linguistic meanings from technical meanings within a science.  
:::


---

## Difference Between ‘Ilm and Maʿrifah

::: {.callout-note title="‘Ilm (علم) vs Maʿrifah (معرفة)"}
- **Ma'rifah (Cognizance):**  
  - Perceiving something as it is.  

- **‘Ilm (Knowledge):**  
  - Knowing a thing and how it relates to another (this is often contextual to a science)

**Example:**  
- Knowing *salah* is an act, and *wajib* means obligatory is **ma'rifah**.  
- Knowing that *salah is wajib* and understanding the reason and evidence within the relevant context is **‘ilm**.
