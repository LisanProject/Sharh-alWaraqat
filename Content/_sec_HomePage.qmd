# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The long-term goal of this project is to provide an accessible, organized study companion for English-speaking students of sacred law, based on **Sharh al-Waraqat by Imam Jalal al-Din al-Mahalli**, and taught according to reliable Shafi'i methodology and sources by [**Sheikh Abdullahi Shire**](https://www.instagram.com/abdullahishire_/?hl=en) of [**Miraath Institute**](https://www.instagram.com/miraathinstitute/?hl=en).  

For those interested in learning more about the life of Imam al-Shafi'i and the historical development of the madhhab, please refer to [**this resource**](https://lisanproject.github.io/FiqhalManhaji/course-material.html).


This work was originally inspired by a fellow student (may Allah preserve him and protect him) who inquired about my note-taking approach a while back. In the spirit of classical tradition, I was reminded of **Ta'lim al-Muta'allim fi Tariq al-Ta'allum** (*Instruction of the Student: The Method of Learning*), which outlines adab and practical methods for serious seekers of sacred knowledge.

[Read the English translation of *Ta'lim al-Muta'allim*](https://ia801504.us.archive.org/31/items/53330826InstructionOfTheStudentTaAlimAlMutaAllimTheMethodOfLearning/53330826-Instruction-of-the-Student-Ta-alim-al-Muta-allim-The-Method-of-Learning.pdf)

## Organization

The content follows the topical arrangement of *Sharh al-Waraqat* by Imam al-Mahalli, beginning with biographies of the author (Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni) and the commentator (Imam Jalal al-Din al-Mahalli), then progressing through the essential chapters of Usul al-Fiqh, including, but not limited to categories of speech, rulings, commands and prohibitions, general and specific texts, abrogation, consensus, analogy (qiyas), and independent legal reasoning (ijtihad).

## How to Take Notes While Studying Islamic Sciences {#note-taking}

Many students struggle to retain English explanations while following the Arabic text, especially when encountering unfamiliar words and concepts related to the subject matter at hand. Research from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://weingartencenter.universitylife.upenn.edu/take-better-notes-the-relationship-between-time-and-memory/) shows that students remember **up to 70% of material when they write concise notes and review them within 24 hours**, compared to less than 30% if no active note-taking or review is done.

### Preparation: Setting Up Your Notes

::: {.callout-note title="Before the Lesson"}
- Print or bring the Arabic text of *Sharh al-Waraqat*. Lightly number each line or key statement in the matn.
- Keep a separate notebook or tablet for your notes — leave space beside each line number to write explanations.
- Draw a narrow left column for keywords or questions and a larger right section for class explanations and commentary.
- Leave a bottom section or back of the page for summarizing what you learned after class.
- Before class, **recite Qur’an abundantly** and **send abundant salawat upon the Prophet ﷺ**, intending that Allah opens understanding and blesses your lesson.

::: {.callout-tip title="Reflections from the Scholars"}
Some people said to the scholar of Damascus **Shaykh Ali al-Daqqar**:  
> “We deliver various lessons to the people but we do not see in them the same effect that we notice in your lessons.”  

He replied:  
> “My son — were it not for necessity I would not speak. This lesson you are hearing, my son, is supported by the recitation of ten ajza’ (parts) of the Qur’an before dawn with the intention that Allah benefits the Muslims through what I speak about.”

---

**Al-Haafidh al-Diyaa’ al-Maqdisi** said:  
> "Ibrahim ibn ‘Abdil-Wahid al-Maqdisi advised me at the time I traveled for seeking knowledge: ‘Increase in recitation of the Qur’an and do not leave it. For indeed whatever you seek will be facilitated for you proportionate to what you recite.’”

He added:  
> “I saw that and experienced it many times. When I recited a great deal of Qur’an, listening to Hadith and writing much of it down became easy for me. But when I did not recite, it was not facilitated.”

### How to Structure Your Notes During Class

Structure your **notebook page/notetaking device** like this:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Left Margin (small) | Write Arabic line number, key term, or question. |
| Main Notes Area (right side) | English explanation, teacher’s commentary, definitions, examples. |
| Bottom of Page / Separate Box | Summary of lesson, unresolved questions, or reflections. |

You may lightly underline important words in the Arabic text, but full explanations should remain in the notebook or be referenced from reliable translations. In addition, always, when referencing or quoting a hadith by the Prophet Muhammad, always write out Salawat in it's full form (صلى الله عليه وسلم).

### Minimal Color System 

| Color | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| Blue | Key Arabic terms & definitions. |
| Green | Important commentary or explanations from Sheikh Abdullahi Shire. |
| Red | Questions, uncertainties, or topics to review or ask about. |

---

### Evidence-Based Review Schedule 

Research shows that reviewing notes at spaced intervals drastically increases retention. A simple routine I've found to be helpful is:

  
| Time | What to Do | Why? |
|------|-------------|------|
| Within 24-48 hours | Reread your notes and add missing details (this is especially important if you are re-watching the lectures and catch important missed information) | This prevents forgetting up to 50–80% of material. |
| After 3-6 days | Revisit and summarize the key ideas in your own words. If you're able to, explain to other students in the class.| This not only reinforces your own understanding, but helps other students benefit as well and helps build lasting relationships with students you may take subsequent classes with. |
