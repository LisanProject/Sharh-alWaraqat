    "text": "The long-term goal of this project is to provide an accessible, organized study companion for English-speaking students of sacred law, based on Sharh al-Waraqat by Imam Jalal al-Din al-Mahalli, and taught according to reliable Shafi’i methodology and sources by Sheikh Abdullahi Shire (Miraath Institute) (Instagram).\nThis work was originally inspired by a fellow student (may Allah preserve him and protect him) who inquired about my note-taking approach a while back. In the spirit of classical tradition, I was reminded of Ta’lim al-Muta’allim fi Tariq al-Ta’allum (Instruction of the Student: The Method of Learning), which outlines adab and practical methods for serious seekers of sacred knowledge.\nRead the English translation of Ta’lim al-Muta’allim\n\n\n\nThe content follows the topical arrangement of Sharh al-Waraqat by Imam al-Mahalli, beginning with biographies of the author (Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni) and the commentator (Imam Jalal al-Din al-Mahalli), then progressing through the essential chapters of Usul al-Fiqh, including, but not limited to categories of speech, rulings, commands and prohibitions, general and specific texts, abrogation, consensus, analogy (qiyas), and independent legal reasoning (ijtihad).\n\n\n\n\nMany students struggle to retain English explanations while following the Arabic text, especially when encountering unfamiliar words and concepts related to the subject matter at hand. Research from the University of Pennsylvania shows that students remember up to 70% of material when they write concise notes and review them within 24 hours, compared to less than 30% if no active note-taking or review is done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the Lesson\n\n\n\n\nPrint or bring the Arabic text of Sharh al-Waraqat. Lightly number each line or key statement in the matn.\nKeep a separate notebook or tablet for your notes — leave space beside each line number to write explanations.\nDraw a narrow left column for keywords or questions and a larger right section for class explanations and commentary.\nLeave a bottom section or back of the page for summarizing what you learned after class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure your notebook page/notetaking device like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nLeft Margin (small)\nWrite Arabic line number, key term, or question.\n\n\nMain Notes Area (right side)\nEnglish explanation, teacher’s commentary, definitions, examples.\n\n\nBottom of Page / Separate Box\nSummary of lesson, unresolved questions, or reflections.\n\n\n\nYou may lightly underline important words in the Arabic text, but full explanations should remain in the notebook or be referenced from reliable translations. In addition, always, when referencing or quoting a hadith by the Prophet Muhammad, always write out Salawat in it’s full form (صلى الله عليه وسلم).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor\nUse For\n\n\n\n\nBlue\nKey Arabic terms & definitions.\n\n\nGreen\nImportant commentary or explanations from Sheikh Abdullahi Shire.\n\n\nRed\nQuestions, uncertainties, or topics to review or ask about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch shows that reviewing notes at spaced intervals drastically increases retention. A simple routine I’ve found to be helpful is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime\nWhat to Do\nWhy?\n\n\n\n\nWithin 24-48 hours\nReread your notes and add missing details (this is especially important if you are re-watching the lectures and catch important missed information)\nThis prevents forgetting up to 50–80% of material.\n\n\nAfter 3-6 days\nRevisit and summarize the key ideas in your own words. If you’re able to, explain to other students in the class.\nThis not only reinforces your own understanding, but helps other students benefit as well and helps build lasting relationships with students you may take subsequent classes with.",
