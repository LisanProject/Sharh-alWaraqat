    "text": "Intention in Seeking Knowledge\n\n\n\n\n“Whoever strives for knowledge for the Hereafter obtains great gain in righteousness.\nBut he is in utter loss who seeks knowledge to obtain advantage over people!”\n— Poem attributed to Imam Abu Hanifa (رحمه الله)\n\nImam al-Haddad’s intention reads:\n&gt; “I intend to study and teach, to take and give a reminder, to take and give benefit, to take and give advantage, to encourage the holding fast to the Book of Allah and the way of His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, to call to guidance and directing towards good, hoping for the countenance of Allah and His pleasure, His proximity and reward.”\nImam al-Dhahabi notes that a sincere seeker of knowledge will show humility, fear of Allah, and lack of pride; whereas one whose intention is worldly will grow arrogant, quarrel, and seek admiration.\n\n\nThis section introduces the purpose of al-Waraqat, outlines how Imam al-Haramain al-Juwayni defines fiqh and usul al-fiqh, and provides essential background on how Islamic legal texts are structured from short foundational texts (mutun) to layered commentaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture I Timestamps Table\n\n\n\nPlease reference this table to jump back into the recording and match segments to the diagrams. “Page” refers to the Usul al-Fiqh Diagrams PDF that were shared by the Miraath Admin in the class group chat.

However, before doing so, it’s important to understand how Islamic scholarship and texts are structured.\n\n\n\n\nBefore studying al-Waraqat, it’s very important to know that knowledge (as we’ll define later) in fiqh and usul al-fiqh is preserved through layered writings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nMatn (متن)\nA short, foundational text that is concise and is often memorized. Example: al-Waraqat, Matn Abi Shuja, Safwat al-Zubad, etc.\n\n\nSharh (شرح)\nA commentary that explains the matn. May be word-by-word or explanatory.\n\n\nHashiyah / Hawashi (حاشية / حواشي)\nMarginal notes written on top of commentaries, also known as super-commentaries or glosses. Developed widely after the 8th century when writing another commentary was no longer beneficial due to existing works.\n\n\nTaqrirat (تقريرات)\nClarifying notes a scholar writes on top of a hashiyah or commentary to correct, refine, or add legal detail.\n\n\nTa’liqat (تعليقات)\nShort notes or remarks, often written by students or teachers. These may explain a point or clarify a difficult phrase and may also be a collection of recordings compiled into a book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Types of Sharh (Commentaries)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nArabic\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nWord-by-word commentary\nشرح قولي\nExplains each phrase of the matn directly, sticking closely to the author’s wording.\n\n\nBlended or integrated commentary\nشرح مزجي / شرح مخلوط\nThe commentator mixes the matn with explanation, often adding their own legal opinions and preferences within the text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Waraqat is one of the shortest yet most foundational texts in usul al-fiqh. Regardless of one’s status in knowledge (beginner, intermediate and advanced), it serves as a primary reference that is incredibly beneficial. It is:\n\nA matn, written by Imam al-Juwayni, independent of any other work. By this, I mean that when the great Imam wrote the work, he didn’t reference another book prior and is original work by Imam al-Juwayni.\n\nExplained by Imam al-Mahalli in this sharh\n\nOften accompanied by hashiyah in later editions by scholars.\n\nUnderstanding these layers helps the student know:\n\nWhat is original text (matn)\nWhat is commentary (sharh)\nWhat is later explanation (hashiyah)\nWhere the commentator adds his own reasoning or correction\n\n\n\n\nClassical scholars state: “Whoever wishes to master a science must know its ten foundations (mabadiʿ).” These principles provide context about the subject, its purpose, and its benefit.\n\nHadd (الحد) – Definition of the science\n\nThe first principle (al-Hadd) is the definition. It’s imperative we ask outselves what exactly is Usul al-Fiqh, i.e, what is the Hadd for these words?\nThe remaining nine foundations of knowledge will be covered in subsequent lessons, insha’Allah as Sheikh Abdullahi has stated, although he’s hinted at what some of these are verbally from the first lecture. Some of the things I recall are Mauduʿ (subject matter) and Thamara* (fruits/benefits in learning a science) to name a couple.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding one’s level of study is essential, not only because it clarifies which books, teachers, and goals are appropriate, but also because it places a person’s knowledge into perspective and, often, instills a necessary humility about how limited a beginner student’s understanding truly is.\n\nوَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِى عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌۭ\n[…But above those ranking in knowledge is the One All-Knowing.]\nSurah Yusuf: Verse 76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nMubtadi’ (Beginner)\nCannot understand a legal issue (mas’ala) independently when reading a text or hearing it explained. Relies entirely on the teacher.\n\n\nMutawassit (Intermediate)\nCan open a book, understand its masā’il, and follow the author’s reasoning with minimal help.\n\n\nMuntahi (Advanced/Expert)\nCan read advanced works, understand differing opinions, derive evidences from Qur’an and Sunnah, and explain rulings to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase Usul al-Fiqh (أصول الفقه) is made up of two singular words (mufradat): Usul + Fiqh.\n\nTogether, they form a tarkib idafi (construct phrase) — like “House of Allah,” “Book of Salah,” etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord\nArabic\nLinguistic Meaning\n\n\n\n\nUsul\nأصول\nFoundations, roots, or that upon which something is built.\n\n\nFiqh\nفقه\nLiterally understanding something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample in Arabic Usage: هذا / ذلك\n\n\n\n\nهذا (this) refers to something near or built upon something certain.\n\nذلك (that) refers to something distant or previously referred to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinguistically, fiqh means to understand something as it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage of Ma’rifah and Ilm\n\n\n\nSheikh Abdullahi brought up an interesting point (around the 1:03:00 mark in the lesson), one that caught my eye initially when seeing the text — Imam al-Haramain uses the term ma’rifah in his text, although Sheikh Abdullahi mentions that other commentators use ’ilm.\nThe two terms are interchangeable in most contexts, but as mentioned previously, one must exercise caution when distinguishing linguistic meanings from technical meanings within a science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n’Ilm (علم) vs Maʿrifah (معرفة)\n\n\n\n\nMa’rifah (Cognizance):\n\nPerceiving something as it is.\n\n’Ilm (Knowledge):\n\nKnowing a thing and how it relates to another (this is often contextual to a science)\n\n\nExample:\n- Knowing salah is an act, and wajib means obligatory is ma’rifah.\n- Knowing that salah is wajib and understanding the reason and evidence within the relevant context is ’ilm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this checklist to review what you’ve learned and ensure you understand the lecture material from Lecture 1.\n\n\n\nWhat is the definition (hadd) of Usul al-Fiqh?\nHow is the phrase “Usul al-Fiqh” grammatically structured?\nWhat does “Usul” mean linguistically?\nWhat does “Fiqh” mean linguistically?\nWhat is the difference between ʿilm and maʿrifah? Can I explain it with an example?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the three levels of students in traditional learning?\nCan I clearly differentiate their abilities?\n\n\n\n\n\nMatn (متن)\nSharh (شرح)\nSharh Qawli (شرح قولي)\nSharh Mazji (شرح مزجي)\nHashiyah (حاشية)\nTa’liqat (تعليقات)\nTaqrirat (تقريرات)\nIstilah (اصطلاح)\nIlm al-Bahth (علم البحث)\nMustaqil (مستقل)\nIstimdad (استمداد)\nTa’birat (تعبيرات)\nFasl (فصل)\nTarkib Idafi (تركيب إضافي)\nTasawwur (تصور)\nTasdiq (تصديق)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource: Hans Wehr Arabic–English Dictionary\n\n\n\nFor a deeper understanding of the Arabic roots and words used in the course by Sheikh Abdullahi, use the searchable Hans Wehr Arabic–English Dictionary.\nOpen the searchable Hans Wehr Dictionary\nYou can search by Arabic root (ش ر ح, ف ق ه, أ ص ل) to see how you can derive definitions for the words used in class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Review\n\n\n\nMake sure you can answer these questions before moving on to the next lesson.\nوبالله التوفيق.",

It’s imperative we ask outselves what exactly is Usul al-Fiqh, i.e, what is the Hadd for these words?\nThe remaining nine foundations of knowledge will be covered in subsequent lessons, insha’Allah as Sheikh Abdullahi has stated, although he’s hinted at what some of these are verbally from the first lecture. Some of the things I recall are Mauduʿ (subject matter) and Thamara* (fruits/benefits in learning a science) to name a couple.",

In the spirit of classical tradition, I was reminded of Ta’lim al-Muta’allim fi Tariq al-Ta’allum (Instruction of the Student: The Method of Learning), which outlines adab and practical methods for serious seekers of sacred knowledge.\nRead the English translation of Ta’lim al-Muta’allim\n\n\n\nThe content follows the topical arrangement of Sharh al-Waraqat by Imam al-Mahalli, beginning with biographies of the author (Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni) and the commentator (Imam Jalal al-Din al-Mahalli), then progressing through the essential chapters of Usul al-Fiqh, including, but not limited to categories of speech, rulings, commands and prohibitions, general and specific texts, abrogation, consensus, analogy (qiyas), and independent legal reasoning (ijtihad).\n\n\n\n\nMany students struggle to retain English explanations while following the Arabic text, especially when encountering unfamiliar words and concepts related to the subject matter at hand.

This lesson you are hearing, my son, is supported by the recitation of ten ajza’ (parts) of the Qur’an before dawn with the intention that Allah benefits the Muslims through what I speak about.”\n\nAl-Haafidh al-Diyaa’ al-Maqdisi said:\n&gt; “Ibrahim ibn ‘Abdil-Wahid al-Maqdisi advised me at the time I traveled for seeking knowledge: ‘Increase in recitation of the Qur’an and do not leave it.

    "text": "Intention in Seeking Knowledge\n\n\n\n\n“Whoever strives for knowledge for the Hereafter obtains great gain in righteousness.\nBut he is in utter loss who seeks knowledge to obtain advantage over people!”\n— Poem attributed to Imam Abu Hanifa (رحمه الله)\n\nImam al-Haddad’s intention reads:\n&gt; “I intend to study and teach, to take and give a reminder, to take and give benefit, to take and give advantage, to encourage the holding fast to the Book of Allah and the way of His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, to call to guidance and directing towards good, hoping for the countenance of Allah and His pleasure, His proximity and reward.”\nImam al-Dhahabi notes that a sincere seeker of knowledge will show humility, fear of Allah, and lack of pride; whereas one whose intention is worldly will grow arrogant, quarrel, and seek admiration.\n\n\nThis section introduces the purpose of al-Waraqat, outlines how Imam al-Haramain al-Juwayni defines fiqh and usul al-fiqh, and provides essential background on how Islamic legal texts are structured from short foundational texts (mutun) to layered commentaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture I Timestamps Table\n\n\n\nPlease reference this table to jump back into the recording and match segments to the diagrams. “Page” refers to the Usul al-Fiqh Diagrams PDF that were shared by the Miraath Admin in the class group chat.

However, before doing so, it’s important to understand how Islamic scholarship and texts are structured.\n\n\n\n\nBefore studying al-Waraqat, it’s very important to know that knowledge (as we’ll define later) in fiqh and usul al-fiqh is preserved through layered writings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nMatn (متن)\nA short, foundational text that is concise and is often memorized. Example: al-Waraqat, Matn Abi Shuja, Safwat al-Zubad, etc.\n\n\nSharh (شرح)\nA commentary that explains the matn. May be word-by-word or explanatory.\n\n\nHashiyah / Hawashi (حاشية / حواشي)\nMarginal notes written on top of commentaries, also known as super-commentaries or glosses. Developed widely after the 8th century when writing another commentary was no longer beneficial due to existing works.\n\n\nTaqrirat (تقريرات)\nClarifying notes a scholar writes on top of a hashiyah or commentary to correct, refine, or add legal detail.\n\n\nTa’liqat (تعليقات)\nShort notes or remarks, often written by students or teachers. These may explain a point or clarify a difficult phrase and may also be a collection of recordings compiled into a book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Types of Sharh (Commentaries)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nArabic\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nWord-by-word commentary\nشرح قولي\nExplains each phrase of the matn directly, sticking closely to the author’s wording.\n\n\nBlended or integrated commentary\nشرح مزجي / شرح مخلوط\nThe commentator mixes the matn with explanation, often adding their own legal opinions and preferences within the text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAl-Waraqat is one of the shortest yet most foundational texts in usul al-fiqh. Regardless of one’s status in knowledge (beginner, intermediate and advanced), it serves as a primary reference that is incredibly beneficial. It is:\n\nA matn, written by Imam al-Juwayni, independent of any other work. By this, I mean that when the great Imam wrote the work, he didn’t reference another book prior and is original work by Imam al-Juwayni.\n\nExplained by Imam al-Mahalli in this sharh\n\nOften accompanied by hashiyah in later editions by scholars.\n\nUnderstanding these layers helps the student know:\n\nWhat is original text (matn)\nWhat is commentary (sharh)\nWhat is later explanation (hashiyah)\nWhere the commentator adds his own reasoning or correction\n\n\n\n\nClassical scholars state: “Whoever wishes to master a science must know its ten foundations (mabadiʿ).” These principles provide context about the subject, its purpose, and its benefit.\n\nHadd (الحد) – Definition of the science\n\nThe first principle (al-Hadd) is the definition. It’s imperative we ask outselves what exactly is Usul al-Fiqh, i.e, what is the Hadd for these words?\nThe remaining nine foundations of knowledge will be covered in subsequent lessons, insha’Allah as Sheikh Abdullahi has stated, although he’s hinted at what some of these are verbally from the first lecture. Some of the things I recall are Mauduʿ (subject matter) and Thamara* (fruits/benefits in learning a science) to name a couple.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding one’s level of study is essential, not only because it clarifies which books, teachers, and goals are appropriate, but also because it places a person’s knowledge into perspective and, often, instills a necessary humility about how limited a beginner student’s understanding truly is.\n\nوَفَوْقَ كُلِّ ذِى عِلْمٍ عَلِيمٌۭ\n[…But above those ranking in knowledge is the One All-Knowing.]\nSurah Yusuf: Verse 76\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nMubtadi’ (Beginner)\nCannot understand a legal issue (mas’ala) independently when reading a text or hearing it explained. Relies entirely on the teacher.\n\n\nMutawassit (Intermediate)\nCan open a book, understand its masā’il, and follow the author’s reasoning with minimal help.\n\n\nMuntahi (Advanced/Expert)\nCan read advanced works, understand differing opinions, derive evidences from Qur’an and Sunnah, and explain rulings to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phrase Usul al-Fiqh (أصول الفقه) is made up of two singular words (mufradat): Usul + Fiqh.\n\nTogether, they form a tarkib idafi (construct phrase) — like “House of Allah,” “Book of Salah,” etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord\nArabic\nLinguistic Meaning\n\n\n\n\nUsul\nأصول\nFoundations, roots, or that upon which something is built.\n\n\nFiqh\nفقه\nLiterally understanding something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample in Arabic Usage: هذا / ذلك\n\n\n\n\nهذا (this) refers to something near or built upon something certain.\n\nذلك (that) refers to something distant or previously referred to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinguistically, fiqh means to understand something as it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage of Ma’rifah and Ilm\n\n\n\nSheikh Abdullahi brought up an interesting point (around the 1:03:00 mark in the lesson), one that caught my eye initially when seeing the text — Imam al-Haramain uses the term ma’rifah in his text, although Sheikh Abdullahi mentions that other commentators use ’ilm.\nThe two terms are interchangeable in most contexts, but as mentioned previously, one must exercise caution when distinguishing linguistic meanings from technical meanings within a science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n’Ilm (علم) vs Maʿrifah (معرفة)\n\n\n\n\nMa’rifah (Cognizance):\n\nPerceiving something as it is.\n\n’Ilm (Knowledge):\n\nKnowing a thing and how it relates to another (this is often contextual to a science)\n\n\nExample:\n- Knowing salah is an act, and wajib means obligatory is ma’rifah.\n- Knowing that salah is wajib and understanding the reason and evidence within the relevant context is ’ilm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this checklist to review what you’ve learned and ensure you understand the lecture material from Lecture 1.\n\n\n\nWhat is the definition (hadd) of Usul al-Fiqh?\nHow is the phrase “Usul al-Fiqh” grammatically structured?\nWhat does “Usul” mean linguistically?\nWhat does “Fiqh” mean linguistically?\nWhat is the difference between ʿilm and maʿrifah? Can I explain it with an example?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the three levels of students in traditional learning?\nCan I clearly differentiate their abilities?\n\n\n\n\n\nMatn (متن)\nSharh (شرح)\nSharh Qawli (شرح قولي)\nSharh Mazji (شرح مزجي)\nHashiyah (حاشية)\nTa’liqat (تعليقات)\nTaqrirat (تقريرات)\nIstilah (اصطلاح)\nIlm al-Bahth (علم البحث)\nMustaqil (مستقل)\nIstimdad (استمداد)\nTa’birat (تعبيرات)\nFasl (فصل)\nTarkib Idafi (تركيب إضافي)\nTasawwur (تصور)\nTasdiq (تصديق)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource: Hans Wehr Arabic–English Dictionary\n\n\n\nFor a deeper understanding of the Arabic roots and words used in the course by Sheikh Abdullahi, use the searchable Hans Wehr Arabic–English Dictionary.\nOpen the searchable Hans Wehr Dictionary\nYou can search by Arabic root (ش ر ح, ف ق ه, أ ص ل) to see how you can derive definitions for the words used in class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Review\n\n\n\nMake sure you can answer these questions before moving on to the next lesson.\nوبالله التوفيق."

    "text": "Al-Waraqat is one of the shortest yet most foundational texts in usul al-fiqh. Regardless of one’s status in knowledge (beginner, intermediate and advanced), it serves as a primary reference that is incredibly beneficial. It is:\n\nA matn, written by Imam al-Juwayni, independent of any other work. By this, I mean that when the great Imam wrote the work, he didn’t reference another book prior and is original work by Imam al-Juwayni.\n\nExplained by Imam al-Mahalli in this sharh\n\nOften accompanied by hashiyah in later editions by scholars.\n\nUnderstanding these layers helps the student know:\n\nWhat is original text (matn)\nWhat is commentary (sharh)\nWhat is later explanation (hashiyah)\nWhere the commentator adds his own reasoning or correction"

It’s imperative we ask outselves what exactly is Usul al-Fiqh, i.e, what is the Hadd for these words?\nThe remaining nine foundations of knowledge will be covered in subsequent lessons, insha’Allah as Sheikh Abdullahi has stated, although he’s hinted at what some of these are verbally from the first lecture. Some of the things I recall are Mauduʿ (subject matter) and Thamara* (fruits/benefits in learning a science) to name a couple."
